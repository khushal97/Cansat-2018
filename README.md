# Cansat-2018
The CanSat competition is a design-build-fly competition organised by American Astronautical Society (AAS) that provides teams with an opportunity to experience the design life-cycle of an aerospace system.The Cansat included sensors for tracking altitude using air pressure, external temperature,
battery voltage, GPS position and a tilt sensor for stability verification during descent.The data from this sensors is to be transmitted in real time.

This repository is all about the software work of the SVNIT team in the CANSAT COMPETITION OF 2K18. It contains the code for the probe microcontroller.
